This is a Sawtooth trial program in an effort to offer more soccer all winter long. General Rules: All players must sign a general medical release form in order to play. Parents are encouraged and allowed to play. However, kid players are given preference. Both the Soccer Skills Clinic and Futsal allow for mixed-age group play. For example, a 6-year-old can train alongside and play in a game with a 60-year-old. However, for safety reasons, overly aggressive play will not be tolerated. The Gym must be left in EXACTLY the same condition as it was found. Anyone who does not clean up after themselves and/or does not help in putting things back in order when done will not be invited back. Questions?

SPRING 2015 SEASON OVERVIEW COMING SOON Please Note that this Section is a General Season Overview written in August 2014. For daily updated FALL 2014 TEAM UPDATES, CLICK HERE. Greetings Sawtooth United Players, Parents and Coaches! After an amazing summer of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil and 2 incredible weeks of ONE Soccer camps right here in the Wood River Valley, we are now ready for an exciting Fall 2014 Soccer Season! Here is a quick overview of the SUFC Fall 2014 Season: -SUFC is offering 6 teams: 1) Boys U10--STUMPH--Coached by Trent Stumph. 2) Boys U10--HOLTER--Coached by Dean Holter, Michael Desler, and Ted Kelley. 3) Boys U11--Coached by Eric Slotten and Clay Sammis. 4) Boys U12--Coached by Marco Hidalgo and Chris Gardner. 5) Girls U10/U11--Coached by Sally Gerlach and Clint Kelly. 6) Girls U12--Coached by Dave Hattula and Toni Hattula. -Season Begin/End: The season will officially begin on Tuesday, September 2, 2014. That will be the first week of official practices; days and times to be determined by each coach (but likely Tues/Thurs, 5:30-7pm practice times). Coaches may start practicing in August at their discretion. Your team's coach may start contacting you in August with August informal practice schedule information. The season will end the week of Halloween, October 31st. -Player Registration Fee is $260:This fee to include twice weekly practices and the following games schedule: 1) Boise League, Two Saturdays, September 20th and October 18th (two games each Saturday): This is the Idaho Youth Soccer Association ("IYSA") Boise D3 League at the Boise Simplot Soccer Complex. Competition is strong and our teams often lose. We have researched the less competitive IYSA "Outback" Recreation League as an alternative to the more hyper-competitive Boise D3 League. However, the Outback games are played as far away as McCall with lesser quality fields, ref-ing, etc. After much research and discussion SUFC has decided to stick with the Boise D3 League and focus on raising our game to be able to compete at this higher level. 2) IYSA Gem State Tournament October 4-5th, also at the Boise Simplot Soccer Complex. This is also a full "competitive" tournament, with 2-3 games on Saturday and 1-2 games on Sunday. It is a full weekend of competitive tournament soccer. SUFC's goal is to be increasingly more competitive at this high level of competition. 3) "Friendlies" to be scheduled against some/all of the following: - Local BCRD Rec team/s, - Local La Liga team/s, - Mt. Home club team/s, - Twin Falls club team/s. -Why? SUFC has gotten lots of feedback from parents who want to stay and play local whenever possible. We are listening. While it is important to go play the competitive Boise D3 League, we are also working this fall to "play local", with games yet to be determined as we make the connections and fill out this fall season's dance card. 4) Two Optional Tournaments: 1- Jackson Hole Tournament, September 26-28th; registration deadline is September 1, 2014. 2- FC Nova Fall Star Showcase Tournament, Boise, November 1-2nd; registration deadline is October 10, 2014. *** These two tournaments are NOT part of the SUFC regular season. However, a coach/team can rally to play one of these very fun and quality tournaments at a cost of about $50-75 per player. Contact your coach for further details if interested. -Fall Season vs. Spring Season Background: SUFC offers 2 full soccer programs each Spring; which is the Developmental Program, ages U6-U9; and the Competitive Program, ages U10-U17. -However, SUFC offers only a limited Competitive Program in the Fall so as to not compete for players at the Developmental Program level with the local Recreation Programs offered by Atkinson Rec in Ketchum, and BCRD in Hailey; and so as not to compete for players at the Competitive Program level with the WR Valley's Middle and High School teams. Sawtooth is also increasingly working closely with the Atkinson Rec and BCRD programs synergistically to improve the effectiveness of all soccer in the WR Valley. For example, this fall, Sawtooth will offer tips and tricks to A-REC and BCRD Rec coaches in a fall coaching clinic. -Wednesday Night "SAWTOOTH COMP CLINIC": This fall, SUFC will offer a one-day-per-week competitive training clinic, aka the "SAWTOOTH COMP CLINIC" (likely Wednesdays, check back after Labor Day for details) for ages U6-U9, and U10-U12. This Wednesday evening clinic will offer an extra night of specialized soccer training for those players who want additional "touches on the ball" each week. We offered this two falls ago with great positive feedback. (This has been changed to the "SKILLS CLINIC", see top of page).   Player Age Chart - 2014-2015 Season Player Age Chart - 2014-2015 Season Player Birth Month / Year Team Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Month (#) (08) (09) (10) (11) (12) (01) (02) (03) (04) (05) (06) (07) U16 '98 '98 '98 '98 '98 '99 '99 '99 '99 '99 '99 '99 U15 '99 '99 '99 '99 '99 '00 '00 '00 '00 '00 '00 '00 U14 '00 '00 '00 '00 '00 '01 '01 '01 '01 '01 '01 '01 U13 '01 '01 '01 '01 '01 '02 '02 '02 '02 '02 '02 '02 U12 '02 '02 '02 '02 '02 '03 '03 '03 '03 '03 '03 '03 U11 '03 '03 '03 '03 '03 '04 '04 '04 '04 '04 '04 '04 U10 '04 '04 '04 '04 '04 '05 '05 '05 '05 '05 '05 '05 U09 '05 '05 '05 '05 '05 '06 '06 '06 '06 '06 '06 '06 U08 '06 '06 '06 '06 '06 '07 '07 '07 '07 '07 '07 '07 U07 '07 '07 '07 '07 '07 '08 '08 '08 '08 '08 '08 '08 U06 '08 '08 '08 '08 '08 '09 '09 '09 '09 '09 '09 '09   Posted Mar 5, 2014 Competitive Program Team Formation & Playing Time Sawtooth United has updated its team formation and playing time policy for the Competitive Program.  The updated policy is the result of many discussions over the past year with parents, coaches, and other soccer leaders across the Wood River Valley.     Where's my registration fee go? Based on spring 2013 numbers, the pie charts below provide a general breakdown of where Sawtooth United registration fees are spent. For the Competitive program, the majority of costs come from coaching, tournaments, and league play. For the Development program, field usage, the Soccer in the Sawtooths tournament, and coach development make up the majority of cost.   Coaches Needed for Spring 2014 Coaches Needed for Spring 2015 Sawtooth United is looking for 2014 Fall Season soccer coaches for its Development and Competiive soccer programs.

The money and time donated provides valuable resources that allow the club to fulfill its mission to encourage the physical, mental and emotional growth of the youth of the Wood River Valley through the sport of soccer. In the latest news: this fall, SUFC coach Jon Piggins showed his quality on and off the field by being the top producer at Redfish Technology, which allowed him to take part in the company's "One for One" program and designate a local organization for a $1,000 gift. He generously chose to help fund Sawtooth United's scholarship program. "We are lucky to have such community-minded folks in our valley. This generous gift from the Redfish Technology team and the time that Jon Piggins dedicates to coaching go a long way in making it possible to carry out such outstanding developmental and competitive youth soccer programs," stated Liv Jensen, SUFC Coach and Board Member. "Thank you, Redfish." Read more about Redfish Technology's most recent donation. Coaches Liv Jensen & Jon Piggins & Team in Huddle   From the Spring 2014 Season Over the keeper and in!
