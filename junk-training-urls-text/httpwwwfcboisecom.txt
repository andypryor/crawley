Coaching—while important—typically is concerned less with teaching individual skills and more with molding a team. Soccer is different. Although young players might be naturally gifted, they acquire skills more deliberately over time. They learn through instruction and repetition, test themselves in competition, and then refine their skills further. Coaching is essential to the process. Soccer players are made, not born. For that reason, FCBoise coaches follow an age-appropriate curriculum that develops individual skills. Our approach yields players who are versatile, confident and creative. Because character matters  FCBoise enables players to build good character. Coaches and volunteers model qualities like discipline, responsibility, sportsmanship and regard for others. Players devote time to academics and community service. In this way, we help to build responsible young men who will contribute to their communities and succeed in life. Attend an FCBoise practice or game and you will see character under construction. Coaches offer positive reinforcement, never negative criticism. Players pay attention when coaches give instruction. Even though they come from diverse backgrounds, our boys get along, encourage one another and enjoy being together. And they need to do more than just kick a ball FCBoise players commit a significant amount of time to soccer. Parents also commit their time, as well as financial resources. However, youth sports should never be so consuming or expensive that families have no time or money for anything else.   We realize that activities other than soccer are important for developing well-rounded young men. FCBoise is flexible, enabling families to pursue other interests. We also are committed to keeping costs as low as possible. FCBoise’s fees are a fraction of those charged by other leading clubs in the Treasure Valley. Version: Mobile | Web Created with Weebly FCBoise
