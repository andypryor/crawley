The two original clubs that merged to create FCNova wore "Red and Black" as their primary founded colors.  Past the foundation years; styles, colors and retail brands changed often.  With Puma we found a partner that not only provided quality gear and attire, but matched our goals in helping to offset costs impacted by youth soccer families while providing opportunity. In our 2nd year, as part of Project Pink with Puma, FCNova girl's side started wearing the famous "all pinks" for Breast Cancer Awareness and in the process eventually becoming a national brand/staple answering the question of, "Who is that club in the pink uniforms?".  Everyone knew it was FCNova.  Introducing the 2014-2015 brand and the return of Red and Black as our primary colors along with the Pink highlights on our "home" white kits.  The U14 boys have actually gone ahead and purchased the new "all black" kits that the boys side is transitioning into for 2015-2016 and looking great!  Overall the goal of creating a classic professional representation of FCNova while honoring the history of the brand was achieved. As we do listen to our membership, you will also notice that the "NOVA logo" FONT differs now comparing boys and girls kits. Updating both with a more masculine font on the boys side and feminine font for our girls side.   Through continued support of our sponsors we have been able to help offset costs directly impacted by families.  Bodybuilding.com has been a mainstay sponsor in helping with tremendous contribution efforts to our operating budget, tournaments/events support and offsetting costs that otherwise would have directly been asked of our members to cover.  This is why on the new kits, at all program levels, you will see the B.com logo on the youth league (back) and competitve uniforms (sleeve).   Another foundation sponsor are St. Luke's Sports Medicine - Idaho. With the initial commitment of Dr. Jim Johnston, his wife Lynne and at the time Boise Orthopedics and Sports Medicine (now St. Luke's) the support goes far beyond monetary.  St. Luke's provides us with an in season ATC-LTC who can perform initial assessments on injuries for players, staff and members free of charge.  Along with this they support our tournaments, events and the Elite Club National League fixtures.  They also provide coaches education topics in relation to injury prevention, assessment and return to activity.   With this last cycle's contribution, St. Luke's Sports Medicine's support helped us create a uniform package for our U9 and U10 FCN Gunners Girls and Boys athletes. Including a ball, drawstring backpack, shorts, socks, Puma uniform and training tee shirts at no extra cost for over 130 families in that specific age program.  Reducing the costs for kids in their introductory phase of competitive/formal programming. Accordingly, you will see the St Luke's Sports Medicine logo on our youth league uniforms and under the number on the backs of all our U9 and U10 FCN Gunners Boys and Girls Puma uniforms. Join us in celebrating our community, partners and attack on the future! GO NOVA FCNova and St Luke's making a difference FCNova and St Luke's making a difference! Focus group needed of parents with children aged 6-11 years of age July 29th, 2014 Dear Parent: St. Luke’s Orthopedics and Neurology is conducting research on children’s consumption of sugar- sweetened beverages (i.e. fruit drinks, sports drinks) at kids’ sports events. We are inviting all parents (?18 years of age) to participate in a focus group. Focus groups are small groups of people led through an open discussion by a skilled moderator. We only ask for your opinion, there are no right or wrong answers. If you have a child currently participating in the Youth NOVA soccer league who is between 6-11 years of age (male or female), we invite you to participate. We will need approximately 24 parents. Each parent volunteer will participate in one focus group with about 6-8 other parents, to discuss beverage consumption at kids’ sports events. The focus groups will be held the first two weeks of September in the evenings from 6-8pm at one of our St. Luke’s locations – Boise or Meridian. We will need approximately two hours of your time. Food and beverages will be provided for you at the focus group. No children are allowed to be in attendance. Please remember only one parent/guardian from each family will be allowed to participate in the focus group. If you are interested in participating, please contact Kristin Armstrong at (208) 381-2718 or via email at armstrkr@slhs.org by August 25th, 2014. Thank you. Sincerely, Kristin Armstrong Director, Community Health St. Luke’s Sports Medicine  FCNova State Cup Success FCNova "heading to 2014 regional events" After the Memorial Weekend dust settled, FCNova teams came out with some great results over the weekend and a "future is bright" outlook.  Even with no representation via the ECNL teams at U15, U16, U17 and U18 girls age groups due to Elite Clubs National League schedule and showcase in New Jersey, FCNova posted an impressive showing in Boise over the IYSA State Cup Weekend. "The representation was so refreshing compared to 2013, when we only had 1 team in State Cup due to a club decision to not attend with no teams looking to attend Far West Regionals in Hawaii due to cost.  Being fiscally responsible is a high priority of our board and staff to our members!" stated Director of Coaching, Eric Simmonsen.  Eric continued with, "I am extremely proud of all the age groups and genders this weekend.  Yet, also excited for 2015 as we will have representation at the 2015 State Cup at a full capacity, including our ECNL age teams.  We had some age groups where our boys are really showing well and pushing the envelope with the U13 Boys losing on an own goal in the final seconds of the Championship, the U18 Boys losing in the final in a great game and U17 Boys losing a close match in the semifinal.  We also had some validity to our structure as our U15G, U14G and U13G showed the future depth and fact that a club/program at the highest levels, like ours, can facilitate two very competitve teams." The board of directors and staff would like to congratulate all the FCNova teams on the 2013-2014 cycle of accomplishments. The following teams are advancing on to the Presidents Cup Regional or Far West Regional as State Champions: U13G:  FC Nova Pink going as State Champion to FWR in New Mexico U13G:  FC Nova White going to Presidents Cup in California U14G:  FC Nova Elite going as State Champion to FWR in New Mexico U14G:  FC Nova Pink going to Presidents Cup in California U15G:  FC Nova Pink going as State Champion to FWR in New Mexico U16G:  FC Nova Pink going to Presidents Cup in California.   U13B:  FC Nova Black going to Presidents Cup in California  GO NOVA!!!
