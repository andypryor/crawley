NEW STREET SOCCER FRIDAY NIGHT PROGRAM Club 7 months ago ++NEW Program!++ SLSC “STREET SOCCER” What is it? “Street Soccer” is backyard soccer where the players manage the game.  There are no coaches or referees.  Players decide on teams, formations, positions, etc.  They must also call their own fouls and work together.  What is the Cost? Players will pay $5 cash to participate at the field.  This will allow players to attend without making a full commitment.  Show up on the nights you can play and miss the others.  When? Where? “Street Soccer” will be held on Friday nights from 730-830pm at the SLSC Game Complex.  Players should bring all necessary equipment including a light/dark shirt.  Shin-guards are required! Who? All SLSC players are welcome to attend.  Thoughts… Too often soccer has way too much structure.  Ask any good player at a high level what was vital in their development.   Pick-up games of some kind in the backyard or park are always mentioned.  We want the SLSC Game Complex to serve as the “Backyard” for our players.  Please come out and support the program and enjoy the game!

Spring Friday Night Extra Time Club 1 month ago ***EXTRA TIME*** The SLSC “Extra Time” Program is designed for all Competitive and Academy players.  This Program is offered by the South Lakes Soccer Club to supplement the training received in the Competitive and Academy programs.  Each program is tailored to the specific topic and the focus remains consistent throughout the program.  Players will have 3 choices when it comes to training.  These options are outlined below and players are welcome to participate in more than one session.  Each program has its own unique benefits and will allow for maximum learning each session. Speed & Agility (530-630p-$50) SLSC is dedicated to meeting all of its athlete’s needs.  The “Speed & Agility” program is designed for all players interested in improving their overall athleticism.  The sessions will focus on foot speed, (including transitions into cuts and changes of direction) foot coordination, acceleration, deceleration, core strength, and flexibility. Ball Mastery (530-630p-$50) In a team setting tactical and positional training must occur.  Individual time spent with the ball tends to be less as players get older.  Often players are looking for additional training or individual training to help in areas like speed, fast footwork, juggling, moves to beat opponents, and overall ball mastery.  This program addresses the need for such technical training.  While individual training will always be offered, the “Ball Mastery” program will offer a more affordable option.  These hour long sessions will challenge players to take their technical skills to the next level.  Shooting & Striking (630-730p-$50) This very successful program will focus on proper technique in striking the soccer ball.  Players often struggle with the ability to strike the ball correctly and with power.  This program will address those needs.  These sessions will be instructional and will allow players to grow in their individual confidence.  There isn’t anything better than striking a ball at goal!  There will be 8 sessions on Friday nights this season.  Exact Dates will be coming soon! Register here    ·        All sessions will be held at the SLSC Game Complex.  All participants in the SLSC Extra Time program will receive an official T-shirt. Read more...
