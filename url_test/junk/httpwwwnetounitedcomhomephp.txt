Neto United has the only Director of Coaching in the Treasure Valley that is a former player for a U.S. Olympic qualifying team, a U.S. professional soccer player for over a decade, and has been commited to coaching youth soccer for the past 17 years. (Yes, that is Jose in action as the MVP and leading scorer of the ASL) Neto United was created in response to a need for a local club in Eagle, Meridian and Star that would be committed to the community as well as having a home field that would allow players to practice & play soccer close to home. We practice and play in Eagle, Idaho at the former Mia Hamm Fields located at Legacy. Our mission is to assure that the children of Eagle, Meridian and Star have a local soccer club that promotes work ethic, team work and positive interaction with the community as well as peers and parents. Neto United provides a competitive soccer experience for the committed soccer player. We work hard to create an environment that will provide each player with a valuable learning experience, an opportunity to improve their soccer skills with competent coaches, an entry into higher levels of soccer & a chance to be part of the multi-lingual worldwide community of soccer. We support these principles by improving individual skills through well-structured practice sessions and playing games at the highest competitive age-appropriate level possible, increasing the tactical element of team play and by using soccer as a vehicle to promote work ethic, fair play, self-confidence and good citizenship. Neto United's philosophy is that score boards do not determine the winner of every game. Respect, work ethic, development and teamwork are much more important than the score of any game. Our organization's success will be measured by how well we accomplish these objectives. We strictly abide by the rules and regulations of IYSA, USYSA and FIFA, as well as the leagues in which our teams play, specifically to the Idaho Youth Soccer (IYSA) D3 league. We are committed to the players, parents and the communities of Eagle, Meridian and Star.   2014 Neto United U13 Division Champions Come join us in Eagle for the 2014/2015 Competitive Team soccer.
