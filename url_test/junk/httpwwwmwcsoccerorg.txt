The original field configuration had only 4 fields, compared to the 13 fields we have available today. There were no lighted fields at all. The original concession stand is known today as the Referee Shack and Century Martial Arts sits atop some of our old land. What hasn't changed?? The wonderful people of the Mid-Del area and surrounding communities! Without the support and dedication of the community and the volunteers that come out each weekend to bring this beautiful game to life, we couldn't offer as much today as we do for our community and the sport itself. Thank you! Spend some time here and meet some of our people. A lot of our coaches grew up playing soccer right here at this very club and it's that reason as to why they choose to return and coach here today. Despite not residing in the Mid-Del area, some of our coaches are so loyal to the club that they drive in from as far away as Edmond, just to coach here to help improve the club. Some of our other volunteers have spent 20+ years volunteering at the club and seen their own kids go from Lil' Legs to U19 players and beyond. When you meet a volunteer, be it a coach, board member or concession operator...please thank them or join them. Without them and the many that laid the groundwork before, we wouldn't be here today.
