Weather Policy - Sep 14th 2012, 21:43 A note to parents and coaches. We play soccer in the rain. If it's a hard driving rain, or lightning, we have a lightning detector, and will call the game if needed. The fields at the Multi-Sports Complex will take a good 2-3" of rain before they are unplayable. If the fields are unplayable and we have to cancel, it will be posted to the website. Please check the website often. If your kids play U12 and up, go to www.texomasoccer.org  to get cancellation and schedule updates. A very helpful tool for all parents and coaches to receive weather cancellation and soccer club updates, via text.
