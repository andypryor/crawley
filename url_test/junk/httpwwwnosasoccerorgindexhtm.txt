All parents are urged to adopt this attitude, for it is the foundation of which this Association is headed. It is also the purpose and requirement that all youth participating in the program should be allowed to play at least one-half of every soccer game involving his/her team.   NOSA News: Spring 2015 Schedules Available OSA Lightning Action Plan         Soccer Links: NOSA Soccer Mom Blog   NOSA Soccer... Is a fun and competitive league for children ages 4-16, in which our teams grow and learn together year to year. Our organization is made up of teams from Woodward, Seiling, Mooreland and Laverne. All games are played at the NOSA fields in Woodward on Saturday mornings. The Northwest Oklahoma Soccer Association (NOSA) was formed as a non-profit organization to support and propagate the game of soccer in Northwest Oklahoma.  NOSA is associated with the Oklahoma Soccer Association (OSA), United States Youth Soccer Association (USYSA) and The Federation International de Football Association (FIFA). Through these associations NOSA is the officially sanctioned youth soccer program in Northwest Oklahoma. In 2003 NOSA adopted the official USYSA style of “Small Sided?? games. This simply means the teams and fields are smaller, and fewer players are on the field. This gives the players more touches on the ball, more opportunities to make decisions, and more actual play. Simply put, it makes the game of soccer a better experience for children. All of our players will be allowed to play at least one half of every game involving his or her team.   Home| Contact Us| Top of Page NOSA Soccer © 2009-2015 | All Rights Reserved | Website by Julie Miller | Contact the Webmaster
