Nice game... let's do it again! 02/16/2015, 6:00am CST By admin Edmond Referee joins the MLS!!! 02/10/2015, 3:45pm CST By admin Edmond Referee Nima Saghafi joins the MLS at the age of 24 Everybody's so proud and surprised to learn that one of our referees has accomplished something very few referees ever do.  Nima Saghafi grew up playing and refereeing on our fields, starting back when he was an early teen. A couple weeks ago, he joined an elite group of 35 referees who work at the highest level in the US.  Nima completed his fitness test with flying colors last week in California and will begin working MLS games this spring.  Look for Nima at the fields tonight at the OKC Energy scrimmage working with a group of our referees in our mentor program.   Get Connected to ESC... 01/20/2015, 2:30am CST, By admin Read More Edmond Soccer Club... right! 12/21/2014, 12:30am CST, By admin Read More Nighttime soccer is the best! 01/01/2015, 1:45am CST, By admin Read More View All | RSS ESC Board Meeting 0 Days 0 Hours Integris Health, Edmond Visit Website Club Calendar Mar 25 ODP Training @ESC 6:00pm- 9:00pm (CDT) ESC 15 Tag(s): Home  Apr 21 ESC Board Meeting @ Sleep Inn, Edmond 7:00pm- 8:00pm (CDT) Tag(s): Home  May 19 ESC Board Meeting @ Sleep Inn, Edmond 7:00pm- 8:00pm (CDT) Tag(s): Home  View All | RSS | iCal Tweets by @EdmondSoccer ©2015 Edmond Soccer Club / Sport Ngin.
