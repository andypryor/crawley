Good coaching is  not about producing winning teams; it’s about asking every day before practice  or a game: "Is what we’re planning to do today in the best interest of the  kids?" Getting better every day is my goal; Good coaches/players come to work every day to get better. A championship or trophy is not my goal. THE GOAL  IS TO TEACH THE PLAYERS TO GET BETTER EVERY DAY.
